            passionate about exploring new technologies and have developed a
            strong proficiency in MERN stack web development. My enthusiasm for
            Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning drives me to constantly
            learn and innovate in these fields. Additionally, I have a good
            command of algorithms and problem-solving, which further strengthens
